Programming is my passion because it allows me to craft expansive and extraordinary systems ‚öôÔ∏è.
When combined with mathematics üìè, it truly feels like conjuring magic üåà.
Imagine what unfolds when we integrate physics üß≤ and biology üî¨. The only limit is one's imagination üåå.

So, I just want to continue to have the opportunity to create, and develop in this area,
so that I can create more and more amazing things ‚úèÔ∏è

            history: `
I am a 19-year-old student of the Cherkasy State Business College.
I have been working as a game developer on Unity for VR for a year and a half.
I also have my pet project [Depths of Darkness](https://github.com/NeutrinoZh/depths-of-darkness) that will be uploaded to the Play Store.
I am passionate about programming in C++ and Rust, and have many interesting projects, some of which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/neutrinozh/).
I really like developing complex systems, like my own [game engine](https://github.com/NeutrinoZh/chaos).
Or something simple but limitless to explore, like my own [brainfuck interpretator](https://github.com/NeutrinoZh/brainfuck)  

I started learning programming as a child. As long as I can remember,
I have always dreamed of creating my own games. So my first attempts were
somewhere around 10-11 years old with a game engine Construct 2.
It had visual programming, so after a few dozen videos on YouTube I could already make some small games on my own.
Unfortunately, they have not survived to this day (. Sometime around the age of 12 (this was in 7th grade)
I started writing mods for the mobile version of Minecraft PE.

At the time, they were being developed in JavaScript. That's how I got into my first programming language.
Around the same time I was also experimenting with Game Maker 8. It was really interesting. 
I don't know why, but at some point I started learning C++. I remember how 
I developed various game programs with rendering for the console. Around the end of 7th grade
I wrote an interpreter for my programming language that I called Smile.
It was a simple C-like language that I wanted to use as a scripting language for my games.
But at some point I got bored and gave up on the idea. Then I started learning SFML and writing my first games. 
Around the same time I was introduced to Box2D and IMGUI. 
I wrote and threw away quite a few different game prototypes in 8th grade.
And sometime during the summer break before 9th grade, I started writing my own OpenGL clone of Minecraft.
Then, probably, the need for optimization was encountered for the first time. 
It was also then that I first wrote procedural generation using Perlin noise.
I remember that it was quite difficult for me to realize it then.
